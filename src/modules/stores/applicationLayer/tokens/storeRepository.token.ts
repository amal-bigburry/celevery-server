/**
 * This constant `STORE_REPOSITORY` is a symbol used as a unique identifier for the `StoreRepository` 
 * in the dependency injection system of NestJS. It is used to associate the repository with its implementation 
 * for the purpose of dependency injection. By using this symbol, we ensure that the correct repository instance 
 * is injected into services or components that require it. Symbols are often used in dependency injection systems 
 * to avoid conflicts and ensure unique identifiers for various tokens.
 * 
 * In this case, the `STORE_REPOSITORY` symbol would be used to bind the actual implementation of the 
 * store repository to the interface or abstract class `StoreRepository` within the NestJS module. This allows 
 * the application to follow the dependency inversion principle by injecting the repository through the token.
